Dev environment：Linux 4.4.5-1-ARCH
Compiler: gcc v5.3.0
Files included:
	Makefile: makefile
	main.h: all functions and struct definition
	p2.cpp: program for problem 2 (different input size)
	p3.cpp: program for problem 3 (execute range search and nearest neighbor search)
	p4.cpp: program for problem 4 (rewrite p3 using red-black tree)
	p2, p3, p4: executable files for each problem
	gen.cpp: generate random input for p2
	gen: executable file of gen.cpp
	P2_result.txt: result of p2
	P3_result_<input_name>: result of p3 with input <input_name>
	P4_result_<input_name>: result of p4 with input <input_name>

How to compile:
	run "make" in the terminal.

How to run:
	For problem 1, deletion is included in main.h, but not used in these programs.
	p2: run "make run" in the terminal
	p3: run "./p3 <input> <ax1> <ay1> <bx1> <by1> <bx2> <by2>"
	p4: run "./p4 <input> <ax1> <ay1> <bx1> <by1> <bx2> <by2>"
		<input>: input file name
		<ax1>, <ay1>: the x, y coordinate of a point (ax1, ay1) whose nearest neighbor is to be returned.
		<bx1>, <by1>, <bx2>, <by2>: the x, y coordinate of two points (bx1, by1), (bx2, by2) that determines the rectangle for range search. The four pivots of the rectangle are (bx1, by1), (bx1, by2), (bx2, by1), (bx2, by2).
		
		*input is required. If ax1 and ay1 are not given, the program uses (0.5, 0.5). If bx1, by1, bx2, by2 are not given, the program uses (0.3, 0.3), (0.6, 0.41).
